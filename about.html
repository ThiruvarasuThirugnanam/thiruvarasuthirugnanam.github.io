            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Thiruvarasu Thirugnanam, a cybersecurity professional dedicated to protecting digital environments from evolving threats. My journey in cybersecurity spans hands-on roles, impactful projects, and continuous learning. <br>I began as a Cybersecurity Intern at IPCS, where I optimized threat detection and reduced network vulnerabilities. Later, as a Network Security Engineer at Databels, I managed critical infrastructure, implemented robust access controls, and ensured system reliability. My academic pursuit of an M.S. in Cybersecurity at DePaul University enriched my expertise in automation, network security, and testing. While at DePaul, I also served as a Graduate Student Assistant, enhancing security protocols and training peers. <br>Currently, I volunteer as a Cybersecurity Analyst at RYAN, focusing on monitoring security events, conducting vulnerability scans, and strengthening security policies. My certifications, including Google Cybersecurity Professional and CompTIA Security+, underscore my commitment to excellence. <br>Driven by a passion for innovation, I’ve worked on projects like stylometric analysis for impersonation detection, forensic investigations, and secure IoT systems. I actively engage in challenges like OWASP Top 10 and CTF exercises, continuously sharpening my skills.</p>
